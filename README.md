Code-Along 9.1 - Python Packages and Virtual Environments
Requirements
Text Editor (Visual Studio Code)
Local Python Installation (Anaconda)
Pipenv (for Virtual Environments)
Command Line Application (Terminal - MacOS, Git Bash - Windows)
Setup instructions for all of these tools can be found in the Unit 3 Setup Instructions and must be completed before participating in this Code-Along. You should have already completed this step before following along with the first two guided projects. If you haven't, do it now!

Set Up
1. Log in or sign up for a Spotify Developer Account.
Once you're logged in, navigate to the Dashboard and select "Create An App"

Spotify Develoepr Dashboard

Give your app a name, description, and agree to the Terms of Service and Branding Guidelines.

Set up App Details and Agree to TOS

Once you've complete these steps you will be presented with two password-looking things called:

Client ID
Client Secret
We'll be using these two values in order to query the Spotify API for data. Leave this webpage open for now, you'll be copying and pasting these two API keys into your project during the Code-Along.

2. Clone this repository to your machine.
If you're unsure of how to do this, your instructor will demonstrate this step at the beginning of the Code-Along, but if you're already comfortable doing this go ahead and get it out of the way.

Please note that repository is intentionally blank (except for the README.md file). We will be adding more files and folders to this repository during the Code-Along.

Once you've completed the above steps you're ready to start the Code Along!
